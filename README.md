# Wireless-Heart-Rate-Detection-Project
I wanted to collect ECG data via ECG sensors and transmit the data in real time via Bluetooth for the purpose of monitoring heart rate.<br>
Heart disease has become a major problem, especially today when ageing continues to increase. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a general term for heart diseases, including rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, coronary heart disease, myocarditis and other types of heart disease. a) Heart disease can be prevented at the initial stage by detecting ECG signals for this disease. Therefore I have created this small project based on the Arduino Nano development board, which allows for image monitoring of the heartbeat using the ECG sensor AD8232. In this article, I use two Arduino Nano development boards (referred to as AN1 and AN2).AN1 is connected to the Bluetooth module HC-05, the AD8232 to obtain and send heart rate data, and to the SSD1306 OLED screen to display the Bluetooth connection status, BPM value, and current time. AN2 is connected to the Bluetooth module HC-05 and the dot matrix screen MAX7219. The MAX7219 is used to display the heart rate waveform.
